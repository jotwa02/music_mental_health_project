# music_mental_health_project
Course - Big Data methods and tools.
Data were taken form Kaggle and also I did Google survey.
My project was about analysing the influence of type listened music on our mental health. 
Then I created a classifier that classifies people based on their favorite music genre according to their mental state (good, medium, bad).
I tried a few classifiers: KNN, SVM, logistic regression, random forest, gradient boosting.
I compared their quality and I tried to choose the best one.
I struggled with the problem of unbalanced data.
